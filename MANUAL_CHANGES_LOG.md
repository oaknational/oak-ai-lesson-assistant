# Manual Changes Log - Quiz Merge Data Flow

## Summary
We attempted to merge Gareth's quiz data flow from `feat/maths-in-agent` branch while preserving our placeholder pattern fixes. The merge included unwanted local development changes that need to be cleaned up.

## Commits Made

### 1. Placeholder Pattern Fix - 6f067c3e
**Commit**: `6f067c3e52304c5597414acaf20170c045101d0e`
**Message**: "fix: support both {{}} and {{ }} placeholder patterns"
**Files Modified**:
- `apps/nextjs/src/components/AppComponents/SectionContent/QuizSection/ShortAnswerQuestion.tsx`
  - Added support for both `{{}}` and `{{ }}` patterns
  - Updated regex: `/\{\{ ?\}\}/g` to match both formats
  - Added dual pattern checks: `content === "{{ }}" || content === "{{}}"`
- `packages/exports/src/gSuite/docs/quiz/table-generators/index.ts`
  - Added detection for both patterns in exports
- `packages/aila/src/core/quiz/fixtures/CachedImageQuiz.ts`
  - Updated fixture with variety of both placeholder patterns

### 2. Merge Commit - 32175cca
**Commit**: `32175cca0e1de9211a12ff87481941d5f5fdaada`
**Message**: "merge: integrate quiz data flow from feat/maths-in-agent"
**Problem**: This merge commit accidentally included user's local development changes:
- Hardcoded debug settings in logger files
- Local development `.md` file

**Unwanted Changes Included**:
- `packages/logger/browser.ts` - hardcoded `const logLevel = "debug";`
- `packages/logger/index.ts` - hardcoded `debug.enable("ai*, -ai:db");`
- `packages/exports/DYNAMIC-QUIZ-SECTIONS.local.md` - local development notes

### 3. Debug Cleanup - 2e58b193
**Commit**: `2e58b193a2a918dd05875649a1dad355743015c0`
**Message**: "refactor: clean up debug logging after merge"
**Files Modified**:
- `packages/aila/src/protocol/schemas/quiz/conversion/rawQuizIngest.ts`
  - Replaced `console.log` with `aiLogger` usage
- Test files (removed console.log statements):
  - `packages/aila/src/core/quiz/OpenAIRanker.test.ts`
  - `packages/aila/src/core/quiz/combinePromptsAndQuestions.test.ts`
  - `packages/aila/src/core/quiz/generators/MLQuizGenerator.test.ts`
  - `packages/aila/src/core/quiz/rerankers/ReturnFirstReranker.test.ts`

## Merge Conflicts Resolved
During the merge, we manually resolved conflicts in:
- Package versions and dependencies
- Quiz service interfaces and implementations
- Logger configurations

## Attempted Fixes
1. **Interactive Rebase**: Attempted `git rebase -i` to clean merge commit but hit immediate conflicts
2. **Direct File Edits**: Attempted to manually revert logger files but were interrupted

## Next Steps
1. Reset hard to base branch `feat/dynamic-quiz-sections`
2. Properly stash local development changes before merge
3. Re-merge `feat/maths-in-agent` branch
4. Re-apply placeholder pattern fixes cleanly
5. Re-apply debug cleanup properly

## Key Technical Changes to Preserve
- Placeholder pattern normalization using `/\{\{ ?\}\}/g` regex
- ShortAnswerQuestion component updates for dual pattern support
- Export table generator updates
- aiLogger usage instead of console.log in rawQuizIngest.ts
- Test file console.log cleanup
