Imagine having a big empire that stretches across many countries, just like a giant puzzle with many pieces. The Roman Empire was just like that, and it was hard to keep all the pieces together.\n\nFirst, we'll learn why the Romans left. They didn't leave because of something happening just in Britain, but because they had to deal with problems in other parts of their empire. Imagine if you had to leave a toy behind because you needed to take care of something important somewhere else.\n\nNext, we'll see what happened to Britain after the Romans left. It was like removing a piece from the puzzle. New people, like the Saxons, started to come in and change things. Some roads and towns began to crumble because they weren't looked after.\n\nFinally, we'll talk about how these changes affected the people living in Britain. Some were happy to have more freedom, while others missed the order that the Romans brought.\n\nAs we go through the lesson, keep thinking about how these changes were like a big wave that washed over Britain, bringing lots of new things and ideas.\"\n\n### Key Points for Explanation\n- The Roman Empire was vast, requiring resources and defence.\n- Pressures on the empire led to the withdrawal from Britain.\n- Britain's infrastructure and society changed with new settlers like the Saxons.\n- The blend of cultures led to new societal norms."
