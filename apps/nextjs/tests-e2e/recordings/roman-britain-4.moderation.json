It does not contain any discriminatory language, offensive language, or strong language. There is no depiction or discussion of violence, serious conflict, or sexual violence, making it suitable for key stage 1 students. The content does not include any upsetting, sensitive, or distressing topics, as it focuses on historical events without delving into graphic or sensitive issues. There is no depiction of nudity or sexual content. However, the lesson involves exploration of objects through drawing maps and labeling, which could involve minimal physical activity and equipment usage, warranting a score of 4 for physical activity and safety. The lesson plan contains no toxic content or encouragement of harmful behavior.\",\"categories\":[\"p/exploration-of-objects\"]}",
