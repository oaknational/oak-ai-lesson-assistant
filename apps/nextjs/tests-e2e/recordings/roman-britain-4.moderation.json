It does not contain any discriminatory language or behavior, offensive language, or strong language, thus fully compliant in the 'Language and discrimination' category. Similarly, the content does not depict or discuss any form of conflict, violence, or sensitive topics that would be inappropriate for young children, making it fully compliant in the 'Violence and crime' and 'Upsetting, disturbing and sensitive' categories. There is no discussion or depiction of nudity or sexual content, ensuring full compliance in the 'Nudity and sex' category. \\n\\nThe lesson involves the use of maps and possibly images, which might require supervision to ensure students understand the historical context correctly, hence a score of 4 in the 'Physical activity and safety' category.
