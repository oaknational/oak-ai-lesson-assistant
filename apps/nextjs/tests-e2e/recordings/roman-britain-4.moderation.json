It does not include any discriminatory, violent, or sensitive material. Regarding nudity and sex, there is no mention of such content in the lesson plan. However, it involves physical activity elements such as drawing and matching tasks, and it uses external resources like images, which require a slightly lower score in the physical category. There is no toxic content as the lesson plan does not encourage any harmful behaviors or illegal activities.\",\"categories\":[\"p/exploration-of-objects\",\"p/external-content\"]}",
