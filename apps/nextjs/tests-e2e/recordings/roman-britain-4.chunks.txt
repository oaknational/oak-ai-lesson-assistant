 Introduction
 to
 the
 End
 of
 Roman
 Britain
\n
\n
\"
Good
 morning
,
 class
!
 Today
,
 we're
 going
 to
 learn
 about
 what
 happened
 in
 Britain
 after
 the
 Romans
 left
.
 Imagine
 you
 are
 a
 detective
 pie
cing
 together
 the
 past
 from
 clues
 left
 behind
.\
n
\n
First
,
 let's
 think
 about
 why
 the
 Romans
 left
.
 Around
 AD
 
410
,
 the
 Roman
 Empire
 was
 facing
 many
 problems
.
 It
 was
 like
 trying
 to
 keep
 a
 big
 sand
castle
 from
 being
 washed
 away
 by
 the
 tide
!
 The
 Romans
 had
 to
 make
 a
 tough
 decision
 to
 leave
 Britain
 and
 protect
 other
 parts
 of
 their
 empire
.
 They
 were
 facing
 threats
 from
 other
 groups
,
 and
 their
 empire
 was
 just
 too
 big
 to
 defend
 everywhere
 at
 once
.\
n
\n
Now
,
 let's
 explore
 what
 happened
 when
 the
 Romans
 left
.
 Without
 Roman
 soldiers
 to
 protect
 them
,
 the
 people
 in
 Britain
 had
 to
 defend
 themselves
.
 You
 might
 imagine
 them
 like
 a
 team
 suddenly
 playing
 without
 their
 star
 player
!
 They
 faced
 invas
ions
 from
 groups
 like
 the
 Sax
ons
,
 who
 began
 to
 settle
 in
 Britain
.\
n
\n
How
 did
 life
 change
?
 The
 Roman
-style
 houses
 and
 roads
 were
 not
 kept
 up
 as
 well
 as
 before
,
 and
 people
 began
 to
 use
 bar
tering
 to
 trade
 goods
 instead
 of
 Roman
 coins
.
 It's
 like
 going
 back
 to
 using
 mar
bles
 to
 trade
 for
 sweets
 instead
 of
 using
 money
!\
n
\n
Finally
,
 let's
 think
 about
 how
 life
 evolved
.
 Even
 though
 the
 Romans
 left
,
 some
 of
 their
 traditions
 and
 roads
 remained
.
 New
 groups
 brought
 their
 cultures
,
 mixing
 them
 with
 Roman
 ways
.
 It's
 like
 creating
 a
 new
 recipe
 by
 mixing
 old
 and
 new
 ingredients
!
