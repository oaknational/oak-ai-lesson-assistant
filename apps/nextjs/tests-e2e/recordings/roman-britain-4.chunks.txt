Introduction
 to
 the
 End
 of
 Roman
 Britain

\"
Today
,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 learn
 about
 a
 very
 important
 time
 in
 history
 when
 the
 Romans
 decided
 to
 leave
 Britain
.
 Imagine
 you
 are
 living
 in
 a
 land
 with
 incredible
 Roman
 buildings
,
 roads
,
 and
 soldiers
 everywhere
.
 But
 suddenly
,
 the
 soldiers
 are
 called
 away
 to
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 Roman
 Empire
.
 Why
 did
 this
 happen
?
 Let's
 find
 out
 together
!

Reasons
 for
 Roman
 Departure
**
 
 \
n
\"
The
 Roman
 Empire
 was
 very
 large
,
 stretching
 across
 much
 of
 Europe
.
 But
,
 other
 groups
 started
 to
 attack
 parts
 of
 the
 Empire
,
 and
 the
 Roman
 soldiers
 were
 needed
 elsewhere
.
 It
 wasn't
 just
 one
 big
 battle
 that
 made
 them
 leave
;
 it
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 little
 problems
 that
 added
 up
.
\"\

**
Life
 After
 the
 Romans
**
 
 \
n
\"
After
 the
 Romans
 left
,
 Britain
 was
 quite
 different
.
 New
 people
,
 like
 the
 Sax
ons
,
 came
 to
 settle
.
 They
 used
 the
 Roman
 roads
 and
 buildings
,
 but
 changed
 them
 to
 suit
 their
 needs
.
 Imagine
 taking
 over
 a
 big
 fort
 and
 making
 it
 your
 new
 home
!
