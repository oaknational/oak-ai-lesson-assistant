 we're
 going

 Imagine

 fall

 powerful
 Roman
 army
 that
 once
 protected
 the

 is
 called
 back
 to
 Rome
 to
 defend
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 empire
.

 Empire
 was

 lands

 But
 it
 faced
 attacks

 the
 decision
 to
 withdraw
 the
 Roman
 troops
 from
 Britain
 around
 AD
 
410
.
 Without
 their
 presence
,
 local
 leaders
 began
 to
 emerge

 Roman
 roads
 and
 structures
 slowly
 deterior
ated

 people
 of

 to
 new
 ways
 of
 life
,
 and
 different
 cultures
 started
 blending
 together
