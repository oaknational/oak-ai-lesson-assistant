 Narrative
 Script
 for
 Teacher
\n
\n
Good
 morning
,
 class
!
 Today
,
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 an
 important
 time
 in
 history
 when
 the
 Romans
 decided
 to
 leave
 Britain
.
 Around
 AD
 
410
,
 the
 Roman
 soldiers
 had
 to
 leave
 because
 they
 were
 needed
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 Roman
 Empire
.
 Imagine
 the
 Romans
 like
 a
 big
 team
 that
 played
 in
 many
 different
 places
,
 and
 they
 needed
 their
 best
 players
 in
 other
 games
.\
n
\n
With
 the
 Romans
 gone
,
 local
 leaders
 in
 Britain
 had
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 take
 care
 of
 everything
 themselves
.
 This
 was
 a
 big
 change
!
 The
 roads
 and
 buildings
 the
 Romans
 built
 started
 to
 become
 less
 used
 and
 not
 as
 well
 maintained
.
 New
 groups
,
 like
 the
 Sax
ons
,
 started
 to
 come
 and
 live
 in
 Britain
,
 bringing
 their
 own
 ways
 of
 doing
 things
.\
n
\n
Even
 though
 the
 Romans
 left
,
 their
 influence
 didn't
 disappear
 overnight
.
 Many
 of
 the
 things
 they
 brought
 with
 them
,
 like
 certain
 words
 and
 roads
,
 stayed
 around
 for
 a
 long
 time
.
 So
,
 today
,
 we're
 going
 to
 explore
 how
 these
 changes
 affected
 the
 daily
 lives
 of
 people
 in
 Britain
.\
