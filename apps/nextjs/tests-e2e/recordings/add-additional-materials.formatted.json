Write a short paragraph explaining your reasoning.\n\n2. **Reflection Questions**:\n   - Why might a company choose automated testing over manual testing?\n   - Describe a scenario where black-box testing would be more effective than white-box testing.\n\n3. **Practical Application**: Choose a simple program you have written previously. Conduct a black-box test and note any inputs that produce unexpected outputs.\n\nRemember to bring your findings to the next class for a group discussion."
