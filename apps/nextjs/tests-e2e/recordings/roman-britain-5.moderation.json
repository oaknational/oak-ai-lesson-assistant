The language used is educational and appropriate for Key Stage 1 students, focusing on historical facts and learning outcomes. The lesson discusses historical events in a factual manner without delving into sensitive or distressing topics.\\n\\nThe lesson plan involves some physical activity, particularly in the form of drawing and labeling exercises, which may require adult supervision for young children (Key Stage 1). However, the activities are not hazardous, hence a score of 3 in the 'Physical' category.
