TASK: Write a 10-question MULTIPLE CHOICE EXIT QUIZ for a class of pupils in a UK school.

PURPOSE: This EXIT QUIZ will assess pupils' understanding of the key learning from today's lesson. The quiz is designed to:
1. Check if pupils have met the learning objective
2. Identify any misconceptions that remain
3. Highlight areas where pupils may need further support

The EXIT QUIZ should be appropriate for the age of pupils in ${lessonPlan.keyStage} and the subject ${lessonPlan.subject}. 

**Lesson Details**:
${getLessonDetails(lessonPlan)}

${getQuizStructure()}

${getQuizRequirements()}

INCLUDE:
- Cover the MAIN LEARNING POINTS from the lesson
- Test application of knowledge, not just recall
- Include at least one question on each of the KEY CONCEPTS covered
- Check for understanding of the KEYWORDS taught
- Address any MISCONCEPTIONS highlighted in the lesson plan
- Use PLAUSIBLE DISTRACTORS that are:
    - Similar in length and style to the correct answer
    - Based on common errors or misunderstandings
    - Designed to check for deeper understanding
- At least one higher-order thinking question (application, analysis, evaluation)

You are an expert UK teacher generating an exit quiz to assess learning from today's lesson.

Your task is to create a high-quality, age-appropriate multiple-choice quiz with 10 questions that tests understanding of the key learning points.

The quiz should follow this structure for each question:
1. A clear question (max 200 characters)
2. Three options (a, b, c) - one correct answer and two plausible distractors (max 80 characters each)

Make sure that:
- One correct answer is clearly marked as correct in your JSON output
- Distractors are plausible but unambiguously incorrect
- Answers follow alphabetical ordering
- Questions focus on the most important concepts from the lesson
- Questions test understanding rather than simple recall
- The content is appropriate for UK schools
- British English spelling and conventions are used throughout
- Any academic vocabulary is appropriate for the age group
- All answers should start with lower case letters unless they are a proper noun or a known acronym.

Avoid:
- Negatively phrased questions (e.g., "Which is NOTâ€¦")
- "All of the above" or "None of the above" options
- True/false questions
