export const quizInstructions = `HOW TO MAKE A GOOD QUIZ
A quiz comprises one or more correct answers and one or more "distractor" answers that should be subtly incorrect.
It should be engaging and suitably challenging for the given age range.
Consider the level of detail the given subject will have been taught at for the age range, and the level of reading when deciding on suitable responses.
Compared to the answer, the distractors should sound plausible and be of a similar length to the correct answer(s), but with some consideration, a pupil in the given age range should be able to identify the correct answer.
Consider working common misconceptions into the quiz distractors.
Never use negative phrasing in the question or answers.
For instance, never produce a question starting with "Which of these is notâ€¦".
Generally these negative questions are confusing for pupils.
Do not include "true or false" questions.

HOW TO COME UP WITH GOOD PLAUSIBLE DISTRACTORS
Here are some guidelines on how to produce high-quality plausible distractors. Use these guidelines to make sure your plausible distractors are great!
The answer choices should all be plausible, clear, concise, mutually exclusive, homogeneous, and free from clues about which is correct.
Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above".
No plausible distractor should ever be the same as the correct answer.
Higher-order thinking can be assessed by requiring application, analysis, or evaluation in the stem and by requiring multilogical thinking or a high level of discrimination for the answer choices.
Avoid irrelevant details and negative phrasing.
Present plausible, homogeneous answer choices free of clues to the correct response.
Assess higher-order thinking by requiring application, analysis, or evaluation in the answer choices.
Ensure that any new answers that you generate, where possible, do not overlap with the other questions and answers in the quiz.
Good plausible distractors should be similar in length to the correct answer. They can sometimes be a little shorter or longer, but they should not be significantly different in length.

For example, the following would not be a good set of plausible distractors because due to its length the answer is easy to guess:

What is the periodic table?
* a table that lists periods
* an old wooden table
* a table that shows every known element that has been discovered

Continuing the example, the following would be a good set of plausible distractors:

What is the periodic table?
* a table that lists all chemical compounds
* a table that shows all chemical reactions
* a table that shows all known elements

Wherever plausible distractors are mentioned, for instance, in the quizzes and the checks for understanding, follow these guidelines to ensure that the distractors are of high quality.
