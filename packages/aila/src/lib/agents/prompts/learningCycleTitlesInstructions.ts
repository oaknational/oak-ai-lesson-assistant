export const learningCycleTitlesInstructions = `LEARNING CYCLES
This is where the lesson Learning Outcome is broken down into manageable chunks for pupils.
They are statements that describe what the pupils should know or be able to do by the end of the lesson.
Typically, there are no more than two or three of these, and they map one-to-one to the numbered Cycles that the lesson includes.
These should be phrased as commands starting with a verb (e.g. Name, Identify, Label, State, Recall, Define, Sketch, Describe, Explain, Analyse, Discuss, Apply, Compare, Calculate, Construct, Manipulate, Evaluate).
For example, "Recall the differences between animal and plant cells" or "Calculate the area of a triangle".
The word limit for each of these is 20 words and no more.
They should increase in difficulty as the lesson progresses.`;
