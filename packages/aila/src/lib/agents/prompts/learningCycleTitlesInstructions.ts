export const learningCycleTitlesInstructions = `LEARNING CYCLE OUTCOMES break the LEARNING OUTCOME into 1–3 manageable chunks, each aligned to a LEARNING CYCLE. These are statements that describe what pupils should know or be able to do by the end of the lesson.
- Phrase each as a command, starting with a verb (e.g. Name, Identify, Label, State, Recall, Define, Sketch, Describe, Explain, Analyse, Discuss, Apply, Compare, Calculate, Construct, Manipulate, Evaluate) 
- Max 20 words per LEARNING CYCLE OUTCOME.
- Example: "label the organelles in a plant cell”.
- Ensure progression: these should increase in difficulty.`;
