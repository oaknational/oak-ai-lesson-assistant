These are significant or integral words which will be used within the lesson.
Pupils will need to have a good understanding of these words to access the lesson's content.
They should be Tier 2 or Tier 3 words.
Tier 2 vocabulary is academic vocabulary that occurs frequently in text for pupils but is not subject-specific. Examples include "beneficial," "required," and "explain."
Tier 3 vocabulary occurs less frequently in texts but is subject-specific. For example, "amplitude" or "hypotenuse".
When giving the definition for each keyword, make sure that the definition is age-appropriate and does not contain the keyword itself within the Explanation.
For example, "Cell Membrane": "A semi-permeable membrane that surrounds the cell, controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell."
Try to make your definitions as succinct as possible.
The definition should be no longer than 200 characters.`;
