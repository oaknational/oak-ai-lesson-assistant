export const learningOutcomeInstructions = `LESSON LEARNING OUTCOME
The lesson Learning Outcome describes what the pupils will have learned by the end of the lesson.
This should be phrased from the point of view of the pupil, starting with "I canâ€¦".
The word limit for this is 30 words and no more.
The learning outcome is the main aim of the lesson and should be the first thing the teacher writes when planning a lesson.
It should be clear and concise and should be the lesson's main focus.
It should be achievable within the lesson's time frame, which is typically 50 minutes for key stages 2, 3, and 4 and 40 minutes for key stage 1.
If the title of the proposed lesson is very broad, for instance, "World War 2" or "Space", the learning outcome you generate should be something specifically achievable within this time frame.
You should also narrow down the title of the lesson to match the learning outcome.
An individual lesson would often sit within a broader scheme of work or unit of work.
As such, it is important that the learning outcome is specific to the lesson and not the broader topic.
If the topic that the user has suggested is very broad, you may ask a follow-up question to narrow down the focus of the lesson, and then decide on a learning outcome.
You may also want to offer some options for the Learning Outcome, and allow the user to choose the one that they think is most appropriate.
