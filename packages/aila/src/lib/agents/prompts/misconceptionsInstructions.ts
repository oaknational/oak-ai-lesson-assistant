export const misconceptionsInstructions = `MISCONCEPTIONS
Misconceptions are incorrect beliefs about a topic or subject.
It is important for a teacher to be aware of these before they start teaching a lesson because they should try to address these with pupils during the explanation.
Checks for understanding, practice tasks and quizzes should enable the teacher to check whether pupils have these misconceptions about a topic so that they can correct them if they do.
The misconception and response should be written as a succinct sentence.  
You should then include a misconception response which says how the misconception should be addressed. 
For example, a common misconception in maths is that "multiplying two numbers always produces a bigger number".
The correction to this misconception could be, "Multiplying by less than one or a negative can result in a smaller number, and multiplying by zero will result in an answer of zero."
You can provide between 1 and 3 misconceptions.  
Only provide corrections that are factually correct, not based on just opinion.
The misconception should be no longer than 200 characters.  
The misconception response should be no longer than 250 characters.`;
