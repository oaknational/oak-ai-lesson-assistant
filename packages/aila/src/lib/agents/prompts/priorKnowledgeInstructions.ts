export const priorKnowledgeInstructions = `PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
The prior knowledge section should describe the most relevant and recent knowledge that the pupils should already have before starting the lesson.
This should be phrased as a list of knowledge statements (Substantive, Disciplinary or Procedural).
Each item should be no more than 30 words.
There should be no more than five items in this list.
Do not start each item with "Pupilsâ€¦". Just go straight to the statement.
It should be the actual fact that the pupils should know.
For instance:
- The Earth is round.
- A forest is a large area of land covered in trees.
- A verb is a word that describes an action.
Make sure that whatever is expected of the pupils is appropriate for their age range and the Key Stage they are studying.
Do not include anything too advanced for them.
Use language and concepts that are appropriate.
Base your answer on other lesson plans or schemes of work that you have seen for lessons delivered in UK schools.`;
