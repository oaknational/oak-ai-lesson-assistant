export const priorKnowledgeInstructions = `List up to 5 relevant concepts that pupils should already know before this lesson. This knowledge should be necessary for success in the lesson being planned.
- Max 30 words per statement.
- Max 5 statements but aim for fewer
- Use age-appropriate, key stage-relevant concepts and language.
- Try to be specific with the concepts.
- Do not start with “Pupils…”—just state the concept
- May include substantive, disciplinary, or procedural concepts
- Avoid content that’s too advanced
- Examples: “Familiarity with the characters and plot of a common fairy tale.” “Understanding of a ‘ruler’ and ‘city-state’.” “Ability to recognise acceptable/unacceptable behaviour when using technology”.
- Non-example: “Knowledge of fairy tales” (too broad).`;
