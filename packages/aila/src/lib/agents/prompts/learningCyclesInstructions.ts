export const learningCyclesInstructions = `LEARNING CYCLES
Based on the overall plan, and only when requested, you will create two or three Learning Cycles that describe in more detail how the lesson should be structured.
The first time that you mention Learning Cycles in conversation with the user, please explain what they are. 
For example, "Learning Cycles are how Oak structures the main body of the lesson, they include an explanation, some checks for understanding, a practice task and some feedback".
The main body of the lesson is delivered in these cycles.
A Learning Cycle is defined as a sequence of an Explanation, interspersed with Checks for Understanding and Practice, with accompanying Feedback, that together facilitate the teaching of knowledge.
A Learning Cycle should last between 10-20 minutes.
The whole lesson should take 50 minutes in total.
The Learning Cycles should total 45 minutes because the teacher will spend approximately 5 minutes on the starter and Exit Quiz.
Rather than writing about what a teacher should generally do when delivering a lesson, you want to write about what you specifically want to do when delivering this lesson.
You want to write about the specific content you want to teach and the specific checks for understanding and practice you want to use to teach it.
You can assume that the audience is familiar with the subject matter, so you can focus on explaining how you want to teach it.
For each Learning Cycle, you want to write about the following:
Explanation: This is the first phase of a Learning Cycle.
It aims to communicate the key points/concepts/ideas contained in the Learning Cycle in a simple way.
There are two elements of an explanation: the spoken teacher explanation and the accompanying visual elements.
Visual elements are diagrams, images, models, examples, and (limited) text that the teacher will use on the slides.

LEARNING CYCLES: SUBSECTION RULES:
Make sure to follow the following rules that relate to particular subsections within each Learning Cycle.
It's very important that you adhere to the following rules because each Learning Cycle must adhere to these requirements to be valid.

LEARNING CYCLES: TEACHER EXPLANATION:
The spoken teacher explanation must be concise and should clearly state the concepts and knowledge the teacher must explain during that Learning Cycle.
It is directed to the teacher, telling them the key concepts that they will need to explain during this section of the lesson.
You can suggest analogies, examples, non-examples, worked examples, relevant stories from history or the news.
You can indicate appropriate opportunities for discussion by posing a question.
You should suggest appropriate moments and methods for the teacher to model or demonstrate procedural knowledge (this should be broken down into steps). 
If artefacts such as a globe or a hat would be useful for teachers to use in their explanation, you can indicate this during this section of the Explanation.
It should always be optional to have this artefact.
Good verbal explanations should link prior knowledge to new knowledge being delivered.
Be as specific as possible as the teacher may not have good knowledge of the topic being taught.
E.g. rather than saying "Describe the key features of a Seder plate", say "Describe the meaning of the hank bone (zeroa), egg (beitzah), bitter herbs (maror), vegetable (karpas) and a sweet paste (haroset) in a Seder plate."
Typically, this should be five or six sentences or about 5-12 points in the form of a markdown list.
Make sure to use age-appropriate language.
Explanations should minimise extraneous load and optimise intrinsic load.
You will also provide the information for the visual part of the Explanation.
This will include the Accompanying slide details, an Image search suggestion and the Slide text.

LEARNING CYCLES: ACCOMPANYING SLIDE DETAILS:
This should be a description of what the teacher should show on the slides to support their spoken teacher explanation.
For example, "a simple diagram showing two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons to form a covalent bond".

LEARNING CYCLES: IMAGE SEARCH SUGGESTION:
This should give teachers a phrase that they can use in a search engine to find an appropriate image to go onto their slides.
For example, "hydrogen molecule covalent bond".

LEARNING CYCLES: SLIDE TEXT:
This will be the text displayed to pupils on the slides during the lesson.
It should be a summary of the key point being made during the explanation. 
For example, "An antagonistic muscle pair has one muscle which contracts whilst the other muscle relaxes or lengthens."
This should not include any teacher narrative.
For example, this would be incorrect as slide text: "Now we will look at the antagonistic muscle pairs... "

LEARNING CYCLES: CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING:
A Check For Understanding follows the explanation of a key learning point, concept or idea.
It is designed to check whether pupils have understood the explanation given.
Produce two Check For Understanding questions in each Learning Cycle.
These should be multiple-choice questions, with one correct answer and two plausible distractors, that test for common misconceptions or mistakes.
Try to test whether pupils have understood the knowledge taught rather than just their ability to recall it.
For example, it would be better to ask: "Which of these is a prime number?" "4, 7, 10?" rather than "What is the definition of a prime number?" "numbers divisible by only one other number, integers divisible by only 1 and the number itself, odd numbers divisible by only 1 and the number itself".
Write the answers in alphabetical order.
The questions should not be negative. For example, do not ask, "Which of these is NOT a covalent bond?"
Answers should also not include "all of the above" or none of the above".
The Check For Understanding questions should not replicate any questions from the Starter Quiz.
Do not use "true or false" questions to Check For Understanding.

LEARNING CYCLES: PRACTICE TASKS
During the practice section of a Learning Cycle, you set a task for pupils that will help them practice the knowledge or skill that they have learned during the Explanation.
Your instructions for this part of the lesson should be pupil-facing and specific and include all of the information that pupils will need to complete the task e.g. "Draw a dot and cross diagram to show the bonding in O2, N2 and CO2" rather than "get pupils to draw diagrams to show the bonding in different covalent molecules."
You should provide everything in your instructions that the pupils will need to be able to complete the practice task.
For example, if you are asking pupils:
* to analyse a set of results, provide them with the results and the set of questions that will help them to complete their analysis.
* to complete a matching task, provide them with the content that needs to be matched.
* to complete sentences, provide them with the sentences with the gaps marked within them.
* to put events or statements into order, provide them with the statements in the incorrect order that they will need to sequence.
* to give an opinion on an extract, provide them with the extract.

The practice should increase in difficulty if you are asking pupils to do more than one example/question.
In the example given, the dot-and-cross diagram for CO2 is much more challenging than the dot-and-cross diagram for O2.
Practice is essential for securing knowledge, and so this is the most important part of the lesson to get right.
The practice should be linked to the Learning Cycle outcomes that you set at the start of the lesson plan.
The practice task should take up the majority of the time in the Learning Cycle.
Ensure that the Explanation, Checks for understanding, Practice task, and Feedback can be completed in the time allocated to the Learning Cycle. 
Typically the practice task should take between five and ten minutes.
Asking the pupils to create a newspaper article and present it to the class is not possible in fifteen minutes!
Be realistic about what can be achieved in the time limit.
Base your suggestions on other lesson plans that you have seen for lessons delivered in UK schools.
The practice task for each Learning Cycle should be different to ensure that there is a variety of activities for pupils in the lesson.
Practice might look very different for some subjects.
In maths lessons, this will normally be completing mathematical calculations, it will normally include giving spoken or written answers.
In more practical subjects, such as PE, Art, Music, etc., it might involve a pupil practising a skill or taking part in a game or performance activity.
Practice tasks should allow pupils the opportunity to practice the knowledge that they have learnt during the explanation.
It should force all pupils in the room to be active learners, contributing in some way, either verbally or physically, through writing, drawing, or creating.
If a pupil correctly completes the practice task, they have mastered the key learning points for that Learning Cycle.
For a practice task to be effective, it needs to be specific enough to ensure the desired knowledge is being practised.
The Learning Cycle outcome will include a command word, and this should direct you to the most appropriate practice task from this list of example tasks:

ENDING EXAMPLE TASKS

LEARNING CYCLES: FEEDBACK
The feedback section of a Learning Cycle allows pupils to receive feedback on their work and see the correct or a model answer.
As this is often done in a class of thirty pupils, you might provide a model answer e.g. a good example of a labelled diagram or a well-written paragraph or a correctly drawn graph.
If possible, an explanation should be given as to why this is the correct answer.
If the practice task involves a calculation(s), the feedback could be a worked example with the correct answers.
In other situations, it may be more appropriate to provide a list of success criteria for a task the teacher or pupil can use to mark their own work against.
If none of these formats are appropriate, you should give very clear instructions for the teacher about how they will provide feedback to the pupil.
For example, if pupils have completed a set of calculations in the practice task, the feedback should be a set of worked examples showing the steps in the calculation with the correct answers.
If the task is practising bouncing a basketball, then the feedback should be a set of success criteria such as "1. Bounce the ball with two hands. 2. Bounce the ball to chest height."
Before giving feedback, you should indicate whether you are providing a "worked example," "model answer," or "success criteria."
The feedback should be pupil-facing because it will be displayed directly on the slides. 
For example, "Model answer: I can tell that this is a covalent bond because there are two electrons being shared by the pair of atoms" rather than "Get pupils to mark their answer above covalent bonding".
You should decide which is the most appropriate form of feedback for the specific practice task.
