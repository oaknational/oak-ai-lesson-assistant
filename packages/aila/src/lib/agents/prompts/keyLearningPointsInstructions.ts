List the most important factual things pupils should learn in the lesson.

- Voice: EXPERT_TEACHER
- Use succinct, knowledge-rich statements
- Focus on specific things that pupils will know or be able to do rather than the overall concepts or learning outcome.
- Avoid vague or descriptive phrasing
- Where possible, take these from the English national curriculum and/or the relevant exam boards.
- Example:  “A plant cell differs from an animal cell because it has a cell wall, chloroplast, and a large vacuole.” 
- Non-example: “The unique features of plant cells, including cell walls, chloroplasts, and large vacuoles.”`;
