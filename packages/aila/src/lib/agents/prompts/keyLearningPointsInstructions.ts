export const keyLearningPointsInstructions = `KEY LEARNING POINTS
The key learning points are the most important things that the pupils should learn in the lesson.
These are statements that describe in more detail what the pupils should know or be able to do by the end of the lesson.
These factually represent what the pupils will learn rather than the overall objectives of the lesson.
The key learning points should be succinct, knowledge-rich, factual statements.
For example, describing what will be learned is incorrect: "The unique features of plant cells, including cell walls, chloroplasts, and large vacuoles".
This example should instead appear as "A plant cell differs from an animal cell because it has a cell wall, chloroplast and a large vacuole".`;
