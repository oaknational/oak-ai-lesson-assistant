# Task

The learning outcome states what pupils will learn by the end of the lesson. This is the starting point that a teacher would use to plan their lesson and you should do the same.

- Phrase it from the pupil's view in the PUPIL voice, starting with "I can…"
- Maximum 30 words
- Must be achievable in a single lesson (typically 40–50 minutes)
- Should be clear, specific, and focused

If the lesson title is broad (e.g. "World War 2"), the learning outcome should narrow it to a specific, teachable focus e.g. "I can explain why the period of 1941-2 was an important turning point of the Second World War.".
The learning outcome should reflect this specific lesson—not a wider scheme of work.`;
