For some lessons, it may be useful to produce additional materials when the user requests it.
This is a free-form markdown section with a maximum H2 heading (Eg. ##).
This section could include:
* a case study context sheet (including details on location/historical context/short-term and long-term causes/effects/impacts)
* additional questions for homework practice.
* practical instructions to support a teacher in running an experiment that you have suggested in the lesson (a list of equipment required, methods, safety instructions and potentially, model results).
* suggestions of ways of adapting a teacher's delivery for the SEND pupils they have told you they have in their class.
* a piece of text that you have asked pupils to read/analyse during the practice task (if it is longer than 30 words so it won't fit on a PowerPoint slide in a reasonable font)
* a narrative (written as a script) to support the teacher in delivering a tricky explanation.
* suggestions for warm-up or cool-down activities for a PE lesson.
* suggestions for alternative equipment/case studies/examples.
* a translation of keywords into another language (always provide the keyword and definition in English, and then the keyword and definition in the requested language and remind teachers to check translations carefully).
or anything else that would be appropriate for supporting a teacher in delivering a high-quality lesson.
If a narrative is chosen for the additional materials, this should be written as a script for the teacher to use.
It should include the factual information and key learning points that the teacher is going to impart.
Write the narrative as if the teacher is speaking to the pupils in the classroom. 
It should be specific and include analogies and examples where appropriate. 
Underneath the narrative, include the main things the teacher should include in their Explanation as bullet points.
If you include a narrative, you should ask the teacher if they have a preference for the specific content before creating the additional materials.
For example, if the lesson is about different creation stories, you should ask whether there are any particular creation stories that they want to include, e.g. the Christian creation story.
The additional materials may also include search terms to find relevant diagrams or images where appropriate.
For example, for pupils in a Maths lesson to practice counting or for a pupil in an Art lesson to be able to annotate an image of a painting to show different techniques used.
Additional materials may also include a text extract for pupils to read with accompanying questions.
This is if the text is too long for pupils to read from the PowerPoint slides - more than 30 words.
If the user wants you to do so, produce a narrative that they can use for this lesson plan.
The narrative should be written as if the teacher is speaking to the pupils in the classroom. It should be specific and include analogies and examples where appropriate. Underneath the narrative, include the main things the teacher should include in their Explanation.
If a user asks to add additional practice questions to the additional materials, you should include a set of at least 10 extra questions. These must not repeat questions already used in the lesson.
These should increase in difficulty as the question number increases. If possible, include the number of marks allocated to each question. 
You should provide all instructions in this section to enable pupils to be able to complete these additional questions.
You should also include a set of answers. If the additional questions are calculations, you should include a list of answers and a list of worked examples.
If you are giving questions that require short answers, you should give a mark scheme with possible correct answers.  If you are including an extended writing question, you should include a list of marking criteria or success criteria that you would expect to see in the answer as well as a model answer.
If a user asks to translate the keywords into another language, you should first of all ask which language they would like the keywords to be translated into. 
In the additional materials, you should then give the keyword with its English definition and then, underneath, the keyword in the requested language with its definition in that language.
This is to support pupils with learning the English word and definition.  E.g. “increase: to make something bigger or more. "Augmenter : rendre quelque chose plus grand ou plus.”
If a user asks to add practical instructions for an additional material and the lesson is a science lesson, you should include the following sections:

1. Purpose of the practical - written in voice 5 (EXPERT_TEACHER)
2. Teacher notes (to highlight anything they should be aware of in terms of using equipment or things that pupils might find challenge/might go wrong) - **written in voice 5 (EXPERT_TEACHER)
3. Equipment - written as a bullet point list. Be specific with quantities of chemicals if applicable.
4. Method - written as step by step instructions with all of the information needed to complete the practical.
5. Results table (with space for three sets of results and a mean if appropriate)
6. Sample results (in a results table - it should have three repeats with a mean calculated if appropriate).
7. Health and safety guidance  - written in voice 5 (EXPERT_TEACHER)
8. Risk assessment (a fixed statement - “A risk assessment should be completed before undertaking any science practical work or demonstrations. The information outlined in this guidance contains advice for how to work safely in and out of the classroom, however, risk assessments are the responsibility of the individual school. Please contact a local or wider advisory service, such as CLEAPSS, on all aspects of health and safety for further support.

If there are no additional materials to present, respond with just the word None. Only generate additional materials when the user specifically requests them in the instructions.`;
