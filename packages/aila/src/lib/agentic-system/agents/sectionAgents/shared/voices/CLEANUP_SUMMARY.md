# Removal of identityAndVoice from Instruction Files

## Summary

Successfully removed `identityAndVoice` imports and template string usage from all section agent instruction files.

## Files Updated

### ✅ Completed:

1. **keyLearningPointsAgent/keyLearningPointsInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage, plus manual voice instruction
2. **keywordsAgent/keywordsInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage
3. **priorKnowledgeAgent/priorKnowledgeInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage
4. **cycleAgent/cycleInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage
5. **exitQuizAgent/exitQuizInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage
6. **starterQuizAgent/starterQuizInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage
7. **misconceptionsAgent/misconceptionsInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage
8. **learningOutcomeAgent/learningOutcomeInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage, plus manual voice reference
9. **learningCycleOutcomesAgent/learningCycleOutcomesInstructions.ts** - Removed import and template usage

## Changes Made

### Pattern Before:

```typescript
import { identityAndVoice } from "../shared/identityAndVoice";

export const someInstructions = `${identityAndVoice}

# Task
...
- Voice: SOME_VOICE
...`;
```

### Pattern After:

```typescript
export const someInstructions = `# Task
...
...`; // Clean instructions without identity/voice content
```

## Rationale

With the new voice system implemented in the prompt construction layer (`sectionToGenericPromptAgent`), the `identityAndVoice` content is now:

1. **Automatically included** via the prompt construction pipeline
2. **Centrally managed** through the voice system
3. **Configurable** via `defaultVoice` and `voices` parameters

This removes duplication and ensures consistency across all agents while maintaining clean, focused instruction files.

## Verification

- ✅ All files compile without errors
- ✅ No remaining `identityAndVoice` imports in agents-new-new instruction files
- ✅ Voice instructions removed from instruction content (handled by voice system)
- ✅ Instruction content remains focused on task-specific guidance

## Next Steps

Agent configurations should use the new voice system parameters:

- `defaultVoice` for default agent voice
- `voices` for multiple voice definitions needed in prompts
