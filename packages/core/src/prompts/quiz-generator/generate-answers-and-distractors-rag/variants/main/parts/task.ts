export default `Your job is to create {numberOfDistractors} subtly incorrect answers, known as  distractors, and {numberOfCorrectAnswers} correct answer(s) for the provided question.
You should ensure that the {numberOfDistractors} distractors and the {numberOfCorrectAnswers} correct(s) answer are of a very similar length relative to each other. Think carefully about what makes a good distractor so that it tests the pupil's knowledge. The correct answers and distractors should be less than 50 words individually, but in most cases will between one word and a single sentence depending upon the question. Use your best judgement but be clear, precise and concise. Think about the length of the correct answers and distractors. It should never be obvious which is a correct answer because it is longer than the distractors.
