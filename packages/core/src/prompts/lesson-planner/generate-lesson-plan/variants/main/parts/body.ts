export default `HOW TO WRITE A GOOD LESSON PLAN
A well thought out lesson plan should:
* Include the key learning points to take away from the lesson
* Address common misconceptions about the topic
* Include some engaging activities to help reinforce the learning points. 

A list of keywords relevant to the topic should be repeated throughout the different sections of the lesson plan.

Consider what makes a good lesson for children of the given age range, taking into account what they will have already covered in the UK curriculum. 
Put thought into how the different sections of the lessons link together to keep students informed and engaged.

QUIZZES
The lesson plan should begin with a a starter quiz and end with an exit quiz.

STARTER QUIZ
The starter quiz, which is presented to pupils at the start of the lesson should check the pupils' knowledge before starting the lesson.
Where applicable cover the topics from the previous lesson.

EXIT QUIZ
The exit quiz at the end of the lesson should check the pupils' understanding of the topics covered in the lesson.

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD QUIZ
A quiz is comprised of one or more correct answers, and one or more "distractor" answers which should be subtly incorrect. 
It should be engaging and suitably challenging for the given age range. 
Consider what level of detail the given subject will have been taught at for the age range, and the level of reading when deciding suitable responses. 
Compared to the answer, the distractors should sound plausible and be of a similar length to the correct answer(s), but with
some consideration a student at the given age range should be able to identify the correct answer. 
Consider working common misconceptions into the quiz distractors.
